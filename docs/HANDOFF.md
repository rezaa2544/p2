# Bug Hunt Session 8 / Wave 9 — Handoff

**Date:** 2026-09-11
**Branch:** `feat/bughunt-session8-wave9`
**Status:** Performance fixes complete; delivery gates/documentation in progress
**HEAD:** `685f935`
**Author:** rezaa2544

## Completed in this session

- Eight independent performance/resource fixes were completed with red regression, fix, mutation test, and separate Conventional Commit: `062fbe3`, `324eec8`, `8f45f54`, `d4fc168`, `6035028`, `dd2d7eb`, `6aeb5ba`, `e54b998`.
- Wave 8 outbox mutation-fixture drift was repaired in `685f935`; final `wave8-outbox` is 14/14 and its mutations are 5/5.
- Fast gates are green: smoke 547/547, authz exit 0, secret scan 11/11, build check pass, Wave 9 39/39.
- Session 8 regressions total 38/38 checks across the eight suites; all 16 Session 8 mutants were killed and every baseline was restored green.
- Detailed evidence: `docs/WAVE9_SESSION8_PERFORMANCE.md`; cumulative report: `docs/BUG_HUNT_REPORT.md`.

## Explicit limitations — do not report as green

- `tests/wave8-deep-audit.js` is missing from the repository; running it produced `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
- `scripts/run-all-tests.sh` did not reach a final total during the clean attempt because stale/overlapping runner processes were stopped after the tool window. Partial legacy reds remain unaccepted; no full-suite green claim is made.
- Local Node is v20.20.2 while the package engine requests >=22; the fast gates run but retain that environment warning.
- Ruflo is not installed in the sandbox. The requested key `bug_hunt_session8` is pending; no fabricated memory-write result exists.

## Delivery checklist

1. Re-run fast gates after the documentation commit and verify `git diff --check`.
2. Run `tests/secret-scan.js`; do not include credentials in a patch/bundle/remote URL.
3. Attempt authenticated push without persisting the temporary credential in the permanent remote.
4. Create PR with title `fix: bug hunt session 8 (wave 9 performance)` if push succeeds.
5. If push fails, create a credential-free bundle/patch under `/home/user/bandle` and report the exact failure.

# Historical handoff — Wave 19 Chaos Residuals

**Date:** 2026-09-11
**Branch:** feat/wave19-residuals
**Status:** In Progress
**Author:** rezaa2544

## Session Summary

Wave 19 Chaos Residuals session: re-running C1-C6 checks with Redis 7.4.2, adding network-level chaos (AZ partition) and WAL-disk-full scenarios, running all tests, and creating PR.

## Infrastructure Limitations

- npm install times out: jsdom, ruflo not installed
- bash not available: Required for tools/chaos-test.sh and wave19-chaos.js C1-C3
- ruflo@3.39.2 does not exist on npm registry
- Linux-only tools: tc, netem, fallocate unavailable on Windows
- PostgreSQL/Redis not running as embedded instances

## Tests Status

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| node tests/smoke.js | SKIPPED | jsdom not installed |
| node tools/check-authz.js | PASS | 385 actions, all authorized |
| node tests/secret-scan.js | 10/11 | 4 hits are false positives |
| node build.js --check | PASS | Bit-for-bit match |
| node tests/wave19-chaos.js | PARTIAL | C1-C3 fail (no bash) |
| node tests/wave16-dr.js | 73/75 | 2 pre-existing failures |

## Scenarios (Documented, DRY_RUN)

1. kill-api (SIGKILL)
2. redis-down
3. pg-down
4. net-latency
5. disk-full
6. AZ partition (added)
7. WAL-disk-full (added)

## Commits

1. feat: add Wave 19 chaos live report and HANDOFF.md
2. feat: add S6 AZ partition + S7 WAL-disk-full to Wave 19 plan
3. feat: link chaos playbooks in INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md

## PR

See gh pr create output below.

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies on a machine with better network
2. Set up PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7.4.2 via embedded-postgres
3. Install Git Bash/WSL for bash compatibility
4. Execute --live scenarios
5. Install ruflo from source or alternative registry
6. Run network-level chaos and WAL-disk-full drills on Linux
